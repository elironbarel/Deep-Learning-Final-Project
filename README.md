# Deep Learning Project: Identifying a Specific Dog

## Project Overview
This deep learning project focuses on identifying a specific dog based on images taken from various angles and at different ages. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish images of the target dog from other dogs in the dataset.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**, which contains **20,580 images** of dogs from different breeds. The dataset has been repurposed to train a binary classifier that differentiates between images of the specific dog and all other dogs.

### Data Preprocessing
- Images are **resized** to a fixed size (e.g., 150x150).
- **Normalization** is applied to pixel values to enhance model performance.
- **Data augmentation** is performed for the specific dogâ€™s images, including:
  - Rotation
  - Horizontal flipping
  - Zoom and brightness adjustments

## Model Architecture
The model is implemented using **PyTorch** and follows a CNN-based approach:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features.
- **Max-Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensions while retaining key information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Map extracted features to classification output.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting.
- **Sigmoid Activation**: Outputs the probability of the image being the target dog.

## Training
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss)
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of **0.001**
- **Epochs**: 10
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilized for faster training

## Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
- The validation dataset is used to monitor performance and avoid overfitting.

## Results
- The final model achieves **high accuracy** in distinguishing the specific dog from other breeds.
- Training and validation loss curves are analyzed to ensure proper learning without overfitting.
- Feature maps and learned filters are visualized to understand what the CNN is focusing on.
